      <h3>Scene 1: How Has Home Advantage Changed Over Time?</h3>
      <p id="scene1-description">
        This chart looks at how home advantage in football has evolved over the past 15+ years.
        <br /><br />
        It shows the average goal difference between home and away teams in the top five European leagues over time.
        <br /><br />
        “Home goal differential” means the average number of goals scored by the home team minus those scored by the
        away team. Any positive value indicates that there is a home advantage, however, the smaller the value, the less
        the advantage is felt.
